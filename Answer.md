Q.1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans. The relationship between the "Product" and "Product Category" entities in the above diagram is a one-to-many relationship. This means that each product can only belong to one product category, but a product category can have many products. For example, a product category might be "Electronics," and the products in that category might be "laptops," "phones," and "tablets."
This relationship is represented in the diagram by the line between the two entities. The line has a crow's foot on the "Product" side, which indicates that there can be many products for each product category.
The one-to-many relationship between products and product categories is a common one in databases. It allows you to organize your data in a way that makes it easy to find and retrieve the information you need.

Q.2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans. There are a few ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it.
One way is to use a foreign key constraint. A foreign key constraint is a database constraint that ensures that the value of a column in one table matches the value of a column in another table. In this case, the foreign key column would be the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, and the primary key column would be the "id" column in the "Category" table.
Another way to ensure that each product has a valid category assigned to it is to use a trigger. A trigger is a database object that is automatically executed when a certain event occurs, such as when a row is inserted into or updated in a table. In this case, the trigger would be executed when a row is inserted into the "Product" table. The trigger would check to make sure that the value of the "category_id" column is a valid category ID. If it is not, the trigger would prevent the row from being inserted.
Finally, you could also use a validation rule to ensure that each product has a valid category assigned to it. A validation rule is a rule that is defined on a table column and that must be met in order for a row to be inserted or updated. In this case, the validation rule would check to make sure that the value of the "category_id" column is a valid category ID. If it is not, the validation rule would prevent the row from being inserted or updated.
